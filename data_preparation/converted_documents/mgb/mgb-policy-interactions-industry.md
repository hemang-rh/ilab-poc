## Preface, Purpose, and Administration

## P.1. Purpose of the Policy

## P.1.1 Importance of Collaboration with Industry

Mass General Brigham ('MGB'), its Affiliated Institutions, their leadership, and their individuals have a long history of supporting collaborations with Industry and other Outside Entities.  Preserving these relationships is essential because they advance MGB's mission of providing, promoting, and supporting high quality and leading edge patient care, research, and medical education.

At the same time, MGB recognizes that conflicts of interest, and the appearance of conflict of interest, may arise from these interactions. These conflicts create a risk that integrity, independence, leadership, exercise of professional judgment, or the reputation of MGB may be compromised. However, in most cases these risks are manageable and the relationships are encouraged and allowed because of their importance to the advancement of MGB's mission.

Interactions with Industry and other Outside Entities also have the potential to create conflicts of commitment, in that Outside Activities or Financial Interests may deter individuals from devoting an appropriate amount of time, energy, creativity, or other personal resources to their MGB responsibilities. Here too, these risks are generally manageable and do not prevent relationships from going forward.

To assure that these relationships are reviewed consistently with these values, MGB has adopted this Mass General Brigham Policy for Interactions with Industry and Other Outside Entities to evaluate and appropriately address these relationships.

Note : The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Except for Section 1.2.3, terms in this Policy that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.  Italicized terms in Section 1.2.3 shall have the meaning specified in the HMS Conflicts Policy.

## P.1. Purpose of the Policy, Continued

## P.1.2 Definition Of Conflict Of Interest

For purposes of this Policy, a 'conflict of interest' refers in general to 'a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgment or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest' (Institute of Medicine, 2009).

These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:

- · Those where outside financial or other interests may inappropriately influence the way the individual carries out his or her MGB responsibilities, or
- · Those where an individual's outside interests may be adverse to MGB, or
- · Those where an individual has the opportunity to use his or her MGB position for personal financial gain.

The determination of the existence of a conflict of interest, according to the standards specified above, is based on an evaluation of relevant facts and circumstances by the decision-making entity designated in this Policy for that particular context, as may be more specifically detailed in this Policy.

## P.1.3 Purpose The purpose of the Mass General Brigham Policy for Interactions with Industry and Other Outside Entities is to

- · Maintain the highest standards of integrity and professionalism in all MGB activities and affairs
- · Support principled relationships with Industry and other Outside Entities that advance patient care, research, and medical education consistent with these standards, and
- · Preserve public confidence that these standards are and will be maintained.

Clinical Research Rule (The 'I(a) Rule'):   It is presumed that Researchers who Participate in Clinical Research  may not have a Financial Interest (Equity or Income) exceeding the de  minimis thresholds in a Business whose Technology is being  investigated. The presumption may be overcome when, in the  judgment of the HMS Standing Committee on Conflicts of Interest  and Commitment (Standing Committee) or its designee, individuals  holding presumptively prohibited Financial Interests present  demonstrable, compelling justification - consistent with the rights and  welfare of Clinical Research subjects - for being permitted to  simultaneously hold the Financial Interest and Participate in the  Clinical Research. |
| Impermissible  Financial   Conflicts of  Interest   Continued |                       | De Minimis Thresholds: Researchers may receive  $25,000 or less  annually 1  from a Business in the form of  Income  (e.g., consulting fees or  other remuneration for services) and still Participate in Clinical Research  on the Business's Technology. Furthermore, Researchers may have an  Equity Financial Interest of $50,000 or less  in a publicly held Business  and continue to Participate in Clinical Research on the Business's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Duration of Restriction: A Researcher must be free of all Financial  Interests above the de minimis thresholds from a relevant Business prior to  commencing the Clinical Research. Participation in Clinical Research  shall apply for the entire duration of the Clinical Research and the rule  continues to apply even should the Researcher elect to terminate Clinical  Research activities. 2 The rule shall apply until the date that is the later of (i) six (6) months  following the last day that a human study participant completes the                                                                                     |

## Section 2 Clinical Care and Interactions with Industry

## 2.1. Policy Overview

## 2.1.1 Policy

## 2.1.2 Definition of Clinical Conflict of Interest

A clinical conflict of interest may exist when a MGB Individual covered by this Section 2 has a personal Financial Interest or Outside Activity with a manufacturer of a drug, device, or other products for use in patient care, according to thresholds that may be established from time to time by COA, which could influence or be perceived as influencing his/her clinical decisionmaking or interactions with his/her patients.

A clinical conflict of interest may arise when MGB receives royalties derived from the sales of a particular drug, device, or other technology and, under institutional royalty-sharing policies, a MGB Individual subject to this Section 2 shares in those royalties according to thresholds that may be established from time to time by COA and uses the drug, device, or other technology in his/her clinical practice at MGB.

To Table of Content

Collaborations between MGB Individuals providing patient care and Industry present unique opportunities to improve and advance patient care.  However, these collaborations must be carefully managed to avoid improper influence and inducements in clinical care.  MGB encourages such collaborations, subject to the requirements of this Section 2.

MGB Individuals subject to this Section 2 are responsible for compliance with this Section.

Note: The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Other terms in this Section 2 that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.

## 2.1. Policy Overview , Continued

## 2.1.3 Ancillary Equipment

## 2.1.4 To Whom the Policy Applies

Section 2 applies to any MGB Individual who is a licensed caregiver and who, in the course and scope of his/her MGB responsibilities, provides to patients the care for which he/she is licensed.

To Table of Content

Conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with the purchase of ancillary equipment (e.g., equipment whose use does not require active selection by a MGB Individual as part of a specific clinical procedure, such as standard hospital equipment like scissors, sutures, and skin staples) for use at MGB patient care facilities are addressed in Section 5 of this Policy. Accordingly, this Section 2 does not address the use of ancillary equipment, even though the equipment may be utilized during a patient's medical treatment.

## 2.3. Oversight of Clinical Conflicts of Interest

2.3.1 COA's Authority for Evaluating and Managing Clinical Conflicts of Interest

COA shall review and, where appropriate, manage those Financial Interests and Outside Activities that are deemed clinical conflicts of interest, according to thresholds established by COA.

## 2.3.2

Management of Clinical Conflicts of Interest

## 2.3.3 Disclosure to Patients

## 2.3.4

Clinical Care and Royalties Through the Institution

Because of the special circumstances associated with the physician-patient relationships and the exigencies of clinical care situations, management of any clinical conflict of interest shall be tailored to fit individual circumstances. Possible management mechanisms for clinical conflicts of interest shall be determined by COA.  They may include but are not limited to one or more of the following:

- · Disclosure of the interest or activity, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3.3;
- · Review of practice patterns;
- · Corroboration through a disinterested process of any prescription involving a product or device of a Company in which the clinical conflict of interest exists;
- · Reduction or elimination of the conflict; and
- · Transfer of clinical care to an alternate clinician.

COA may determine in particular cases that clinical conflicts of interest, according to thresholds established by COA, warrant individualized patient disclosure before a MGB Individual covered by this Section 2 prescribes or uses that Company's medical device, pharmaceutical, or medical care-related product in connection with the care of his/her individual patients.

License agreements under which MGB technology is licensed to a Company must state, as an exception to any requirement that the Company pay royalties to MGB, that the Company will not pay royalties derived from the sales of a particular drug or device to MGB, unless COA approves an arrangement under which all such royalties will be donated to a specific non-MGB charitable organization.

## Section 4 Consulting and Other Outside Activities

## 4.1. Policy Overview

## 4.1.1 Policy

Consulting and other Outside Activities between MGB Individuals and Industry and other Outside Entities provide opportunities for productive collaboration, and foster the exchange of knowledge and information that leads to advances in science and patient care.  However, these collaborations must be overseen to ensure that they do not affect the way in which MGB Individuals conduct their MGB responsibilities and do not result in a misuse of MGB assets.  Therefore, MGB encourages such relationships, subject to the requirements of this Section 4.

All MGB Individuals subject to this Section 4 are responsible for compliance with this Section 4.

Subject to the reserved authority of PICC as referenced in Section P.2.2, COA has the authority to implement and enforce the MGB Policy requirements for this Section 4 of the Mass General Brigham Policy for Interactions with Industry and Other Outside Entities, including the authority to:

- · Monitor and enforce compliance pertaining to Outside Activities; and
- · Make exceptions both in particular cases and to general Policy requirements.

Note :  The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Other terms in this Section 4 that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.

4.2.3 Prohibited Outside Activities

Consulting and other Outside Activities undertaken by MGB Individuals are encouraged and in most cases allowable according to the provisions of this Section 4.  These provisions establish oversight requirements and minimize the possibility of inappropriate considerations affecting the exercise of MGB responsibilities.  However, for a limited variety of Outside Activities, the potential for negative impact on the integrity of MGB missions is high, and accordingly, certain Outside Activities are prohibited.

## A.  Certain Company or Other Outside Entity Speaking and Training Engagements

Many speaking and training engagements for Companies or Other Outside Entities are encouraged, including CME presentations sponsored by accredited CME providers.  However, other engagements may compromise the independence and the reputation of the speaker and of MGB to such an extent that they are not allowed.  These engagements are described below.

Neither a Covered Individual, nor any other MGB Individual who is Acting in a MGB Capacity (except outside Trustees, Directors, and committee members),  may participate in:

- · Any arrangement or speaking engagement that is termed a 'Speakers Bureau'; or
- · Any speaking engagement for which a Company or Other Outside Entity has the contractual right to control what the individual says or otherwise has the final right of approval for content and edits of the individual's presentation materials; or
- · Any arrangement between an individual and a Company or Other Outside Entity
- o under which an agreement indicates that the speaker's name will be on a list of speakers or potential speakers; or
- o under which the individual will be engaged in promotional activity for the Company or Other Outside Entity; or
- · Any other exceptional circumstances as determined by the Committee on Conflicts of Interest (COA), including but not limited to excessive frequency of, or excessive compensation for, speaking engagements.

Supervisors have the right to review any and all Outside Activities, whether or not covered by a Written Agreement, of Covered Individuals who report to them.

Supervisors have the right and authority to disapprove any Outside Activity if, in the supervisor's judgment, the amount of time, compensation, or other factors would interfere with the Covered Individual's MGB responsibilities.

In reviewing and deciding whether to approve an Outside Activity, supervisors may take into account any relevant factors, including the Covered Individual's:

- · Level of seniority
- · Administrative responsibilities.
- · Authority, and

For example, supervisors may limit the amount of time devoted to Outside Activities or the amount of compensation received.

- · A Covered Individual may use the name of a MGB entity (in connection with an Outside Activity) to identify the Individual's position or title at MGB, so long as the use, in the judgment of COA, does not imply MGB endorsement or responsibility for the Outside Activity, the Outside Entity, or the Outside Entity's product or services, unless otherwise restricted by COA.

Written Agreements:

- · Should clearly specify all of the services, including scope and field of those services, to be provided by the Covered Individual, and
- · Must not provide for services that compete or overlap inappropriately with the individual's obligations to MGB.

If the field of activity in any Outside Activity overlaps with the field of research conducted by the Covered Individual at or through MGB, then the following additional requirements apply.

- · If the Covered Individual's research at MGB is sponsored by the Outside Entity with which the Covered Individual is entering into the Written Agreement, the intellectual property provisions of the Written Agreement for the Outside Activity must not be so broad as to purport to grant to the Outside Entity ownership of or other rights in any intellectual property that may arise from, or relate to, the sponsored research agreement between the Outside Entity and MGB.

## 5.1. Policy Overview

## 5.1.1 Policy Statement

## Section 5 Apply?

Collaborations among MGB, MGB Individuals, and Industry provide opportunities for productive collaboration and foster the exchange of knowledge and information that leads to advances in science and patient care. However, MGB Financial Interests in Industry, including Financial Interests of Institutional Officials and other supervisory personnel, may result in inappropriate influence, or the appearance of inappropriate influence, on MGB charitable activities.  MGB requires that these Interests receive special review and oversight, as described in this Section 5.

Note :  The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Other terms in this Section 5 that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.

## 5.2. Policy Requirements for Certain Institutional Financial Interests

5.2.1 Institutional Equity Acquired Outside Treasury Investments

Sometimes MGB acquires equity (stock, stock options, or similar ownership interests) outside the normal Treasury investment and Development Office acquisition processes.  In most cases this happens as a result of a license of institutional technology or investments relating to technology or start-up Company activities.  Such equity is referred to here as 'Special Equity.'

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when MGB holds Special Equity in a Company and conducts Clinical Research on or clinical validation of technology of that Company.

Accordingly, MGB adopts a rebuttable presumption that a MGB Affiliated Institution may not conduct Clinical Research on the technology of a Company, or validate or test on patients the unvalidated technology of a Company, (collectively referred to in this Section 5.2.1 as Clinical Research/Validation) if it or any other MGB Affiliated Institution simultaneously holds Special Equity in the Company.

The presumption may be overcome only if:

- (a) COA determines that there are demonstrable, compelling circumstances, consistent with the rights and welfare of clinical research subjects, for the MGB Affiliated Institution conducting the Clinical Research/Validation while it or any other MGB institution holds special equity; OR
- (b) COA determines that the Clinical Research/Validation will be conducted at a different MGB Affiliated Institution from the one that owns or stands to benefit financially from the equity, and that individuals at the Affiliated Institution that owns or stands to benefit from the equity have no significant supervisory or other authority over the Researchers in the Clinical Research/Validation; OR
- (c) COA determines that the benefits of the MGB Affiliated Institution conducting the Clinical Research/Validation outweigh the risks, and the Clinical Research/Validation has been determined by the IRB to present no more than minimal risk to the subjects participating in it.

## 5.2. Policy Requirements for Certain Institutional Financial Interests, Continued

5.2.1 Institutional Equity Acquired Outside Treasury Investments Continued

If the presumption is overcome under (a), (b), or (c), the Clinical Research/Validation may proceed only if COA determines that the equity holding can be appropriately managed, pursuant to a COA-approved management plan directed at protection of the integrity of the Clinical Research/Validation and the human subjects participating in it.  PICC shall have the authority to review any decision by COA pursuant to this Section5.2.1 that has significant financial implications for MGB.

For purposes of this section 5.2.1, Clinical Research/ Validation shall not include research that is determined by the Institutional Review Board and/ or COA to be Nominal Risk Clinical Research. Such Nominal Risk Clinical Research/ Validation is not subject to the rebuttable presumption above, but may proceed only pursuant to a management plan approved by COA, which authority is delegable by COA to OII.

Factors that may be relevant to the analysis of whether compelling circumstances exist for the Clinical Research/Validation include, but are not limited to, the following:

- · The nature of the science involved;
- · A description of the institutional financial interest and how closely it is linked to the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · The degree to which the interest may be affected by the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · The magnitude of the potential risks to subjects or integrity inherent in the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · How those risks could be affected as a result of the institutional financial interest;
- · Whether the MGB Affiliated Institution is uniquely qualified, by virtue of its attributes (e.g. special facilities or equipment, unique patient population) and its researchers, to conduct the Clinical Research/Validation; or
- · The degree to which the institutional conflict of interest can be effectively managed.

## 5.2.2 License Payments and Research

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when a MGB Affiliated Institution receives or has the potential to receive significant license payments from the sale of technology that is the subject of Clinical Research conducted at that Institution.  These license payments include, but are not limited to:

- · Upfront payments
- · Royalties.
- · Milestone payments, and

## Requirement for COA Review and Approval

When OII determines that a MGB Affiliated Institution proposes to conduct Clinical Research on the technology of a Company that is subject to a license or option to license from that Institution and that Institution is receiving license payments, above a threshold established by COA, from the sale of that technology, the proposed research must be reviewed and approved by COA before the research begins at that Institution.  In performing its analysis, COA may take into account any factors that it deems relevant to the analysis.

To Table of Content

Possible elements of associated management plans may include, but are not limited to, the following:

- · Special oversight of human subjects involved in the Clinical Research/Validation, for example, through additional internal monitoring mechanisms or through an external IRB or DSMB;
- · Increasing or establishing firewalls or other conflicts management systems to separate financial decision-making from decision-making about the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · Independent data monitoring to ensure validity, through an objective individual or individuals outside the MGB Affiliated Institution with no ties to the Clinical Research/Validation or to the outside entity;
- · Disclosure of institutional conflicts as defined in this Section 5 in all relevant settings, including to human subjects involved in the Clinical Research/Validation; or
- · Modification or restriction of the MGB Affiliated Institution's financial interest, through lock-up provisions, divestiture, or the like.

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when a MGB Affiliated Institution receives substantial gifts from a Company:

- · That sponsors Clinical Research at that Institution or
- · Whose technology is proposed to be studied or tested in Clinical Research at that Institution.

## Requirement for COA Review and Approval

When OII determines that a MGB Affiliated Institution proposes to conduct Clinical Research sponsored by, or on the technology of, a Company from which that Institution has received substantial gifts above thresholds established by the COA, including gifts in kind, the proposed research must be reviewed and approved by COA before the research begins at that Institution.  In performing this analysis, COA may take into account any factors it deems relevant to the analysis.

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when MGB receives royalties derived from the sales of particular drugs or devices to MGB.

License agreements under which MGB technology is licensed by MGB to a Company must state that the Company will not pay royalties derived from the sales of a particular drug or device to MGB, unless the COA approves an arrangement under which all such royalties will be donated to a specific nonMGB charitable organization.

When OII determines that MGB proposes to conduct Clinical Research sponsored by, or on the technology of, a Company, and that research is within the scope of the responsibilities of an Institutional Official who holds one of the following relationships or interests in the Company, the proposed research must be reviewed and approved by COA before the research begins at MGB:

- · A fiduciary position in the Company; or
- · Equity or other ownership interest in the Company, including stock options, above a threshold established by COA;
- · Annual compensation or other income from the Company above a threshold established by COA; or

- · That sponsors research (or that is proposing to sponsor research) conducted by the supervisor's direct reports, or
- · Whose technology is (or is proposed to be) the subject of research conducted by the supervisor's direct reports.

COA may impose restrictions on and implement management mechanisms for the supervisor with respect to oversight of such research.

- · Note:  A MGB Individual participating in research may request COA's review of a potential conflict of interest, as defined in this section, of his or her direct supervisor with respect to that research.  COA shall have the prerogative to decide whether the relationship merits management.
- · COA can review other situations where appropriate.

For any transaction that involves a contract to purchase Goods or Services exceeding thresholds established by COA (referred to in this section as a 'Reviewable Purchasing Transaction'), the following procedures must be completed prior to entering into the transaction.

When informed of a Reviewable Purchasing Transaction, OII shall determine from submitted MGB Annual Disclosure Statements whether a MGB Individual or member of his or her Family has a Financial Interest in or relationship with the Outside Entity involved in the transaction that exceeds thresholds established by COA.

- · If OII finds there is no such Financial Interest or relationship, this finding shall be documented in writing, and the transaction may be entered into.
- · If OII finds there is one or more such Financial Interests or relationships, the person responsible for the transaction must make a written determination that, notwithstanding the apparent conflict, the transaction is fair and reasonable to MGB and is in the best interest of MGB. The basis for this determination must include but is not limited to: The consideration of at least two alternative disinterested competitive proposals, or
- · A determination that two such competitive proposals do not exist or that it would be impractical to solicit them, along with an explanation for why it was determined appropriate to enter into the transaction without considering such competitive proposals.
